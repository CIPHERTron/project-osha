# **OSHA**
## One Stop Healthcare App

We present to you OSHA a one stop solution for all these problems. You can signup on our webapp as a doctor or a patient. While on the signup page, you can locate nearby hospitals and pharmaceuticals in emergency and make an emergency call as well. As you login, you can see an option to book an appointment with the doctor. Also you can store all your previous medical reports here so that you wont have to carry it everywhere.

Looking at broader spectrum, we have designed this app in such a way that a disabled person can use ASL->text conversion for conveying his problem to the doctor. (ASL ie American Sign Language)

Suffering from an ailment might cause lot of stress and affect one's mental health, hence we have also incorporated a mental health chatbot-XORI as a companion to the user.

We also have 3D fitness assistant and a doctor to assist you in your mental and physical well being, made using EchoAR. The fitness assistant will show you some workouts which will help you in staying fit.
